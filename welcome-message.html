                The Holy Spirit Cathedral is the seat of the Catholic
                Archdiocese of Accra. The edifice, an imposing architecture, is
                second to none in the country. It has served as an important
                space for many Archdiocesan and National celebrations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many people from all walks of life, both young and old,
                nationals and non-nationals have been associated with the Holy
                Spirit Cathedral. The welcoming ambience of the Cathedral
                grounds and its striking calmness within the threshold of the
                liturgical space evokes such a perfect divine presence that can
                hardly go unnoticed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like any other church within the Archdiocese, the Holy Spirit
                Cathedral, through its Parish Pastoral Council, has raised and
                nurtured many resourceful leaders within the vast structures of
                the churchâ€™s Administration over the years. For the Youth
                Apostolate, the Parish Youth Council coordinates all activities
                of the various Youth Groups.
